The Sand Simulation project is a Java-based interactive application that visually simulates the behavior of sand particles on a grid. Users can manipulate gravity angles, add or remove sand particles, and observe real-time particle interactions, making it an engaging and educational tool for exploring physics principles.

## Features

- Interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling the simulation.
- Adjustable gravity angle using a slider control.
- Manual addition and removal of sand particles for experimentation.
- Real-time visualization of sand particle movement and interactions.
- Information panel displaying key simulation data.
- Colorful rendering of sand particles for a visually appealing experience.
- Logic update mechanism to maintain dynamic and realistic simulations.
